# Mult
Mult is an Instant Message program written in bash. It
takes a bit of setup, but works fine.                                          

### Requirements.
Mult runs on Mac(OSX) and Linux. You also need to be on a 
system with multiple users for Mult to have any use.

### Installing Mult.
Mult is an Instant Message program for 2 users. The first
step in the installation is sourcing the `initialsetup` file
using `. initialsetup` in this directory. Once both users
have run this initialsetup file, you will both need to
source your .bashrc file, `source .bashrc` and you'll be
ready to go! Type 'mult' from the command line to access the
chat. Chat history can be accessed in your
`~/.mult/.history.txt` file.
