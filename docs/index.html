      <p class="descriptiontext">Mult is a chat system specifically made for two users. It is written in Bash. Mult is designed to be a simple yet versatile program that contains many input options. There are many programs that work together to allow mult to send and receive messages. Mult is an input based system where you can choose to read new messages or to send messages. After reading messages, you can delete the other person's messages or you can leave them to be read again. When a message is sent, it is saved in each user's <strong>.history</strong> so that it can be accessed at a later time. Each time a user receives a new message, they also receive an alert when they sign into their account. Mult is an amazing chat system that uses bash for communication between multiple users.</p>
